              <span class="underline decoration-pink-500">Answer:</span> null:
              Used to represent the intentional absence of a value or as a
              placeholder. <br />

              undefined: Typically indicates the absence of a value that hasn't
              been assigned or provided yet. It's also used for default function
              parameters and when accessing non-existent object properties.

            <h2>Q3: What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-base">
              <span class="underline decoration-pink-500">Answer:</span> REST
              API stands for Representational State Transfer Application
              Programming Interface. It's a set of rules and conventions for
              building and interacting with web services. RESTful APIs use
              standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform
              operations on resources, which are represented as URLs.
              <br />

              A REST API allows applications to communicate with each other over
              the internet by making requests to specific URLs and receiving
              data in a structured format, typically in JSON or XML. It's a
              widely used approach for building web services and is known for
              its simplicity and scalability.
